# RecursiveAndDynamic
This was another assignment given to me at Algorithms class.

Imagine a thief entering a house. In the house, there are infinitely many items that can have only one of 
three different weights: 1 kg, 4 kgs, and 5 kgs. All of the items are discrete. The thief has a bag capacity 
of n kgs and strangely, he wants to steal the “smallest number of items”. You need to implement a 
mathematical recursive formulation for C(n) where C(n) denotes the smallest number of items the thief
can steal using a bag capacity of n.

(a) Implement a recursive algorithm that returns the smallest number of items the thief can steal using a 
bag capacity of n.

(b) Implement a dynamic programming algorithm for finding the smallest number of items the thief can 
steal using a bag capacity of n.

(c) Compare your results.
